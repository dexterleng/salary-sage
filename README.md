# Supabase Starter

This starter configures Supabase Auth to use cookies, making the user's session available throughout the entire Next.js app - Client Components, Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions and Middleware.

## Deploy your own

The Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project. After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be set up so that the project is usable immediately after deployment ðŸš€
